## Features at a glance

- **Play Nine Men's Morris:** Enjoy the classic board game againt an other human player or an AI opponent.
- **Adjustable Difficulty:** Choose between easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels.
- **AI Opponent:** The AI uses a Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for efficient decision-making.
- **Cross-Platform:** The game can run locally on a desktop or as a WebAssembly application in the browser.


## Origin

This project originates from the module "MÃ¼hle Ki Programmierprojekt" which was offered by the [FMI](https://www.fmi.uni-stuttgart.de/de/) at the University of Stuttgart in 2024.

**The pixel art was partially provied by [@purpurax](https://github.com/Purpurax) so big thanks for that.**


## Requirements

- **Rust and Cargo:** Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed through [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
- **Web Server for WebAssembly:** If you want to compile and run this project in your browser you need a Webserver:
    - Option 1: Install `basic-http-server` using Cargo:  
        ```
        cargo install basic-http-server
        ```
    - other Options are provided through python3, npm, ...
- **Docker:** If you want to build with docker get it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).


## Build and Start the Game as an desktop application

Download the project and open a terminal in the relativ path. Then run:
```
cargo run --release
```


## Build the game for the browser with WebAssembly

1. **Option:** Let Docker compile and build everything. You may want to
change the port in the `docker-compose.yaml` otherwise open [localhost:8006](http://localhost:8006) after running:
    ```
    docker compose up
    ```

2.   
    1. **Add the WebAssembly Target:**
        ```
        rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
        ```
    2. **Build the Project:**
        ```
        cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
        ```
    3. **Start the WebServer:**
        - **Option 1:**
        ```
        basic-http-server .
        ```
        - **Option 2:** with the command of the webserver you installed.
        - **Option 3:** change the port if you want otherwise open [localhost:8006](http://localhost:8006).
    



Disclaimer: If you don't use the `--release` flag make sure to update the path in the index.html to the wasm file.




## Implementation

### Game board

The 24 positions of the game board are stored in an u64. One position is stored in 2 bit where 0b11 represents a white token 0b10 a black one and 0b00 and empty position. The two bit positions are from the beginning of the u64 aligned as the image shows

![Datastructure image](./resources/datastructure.png)

Furthermore, the remaining 16 bits are used to store the current token count of black and white tokens and for each of them the number of possible moves. Because, you need 5 bits each for the possible moves, you only have 3 bits each left for the token count which doesn't fit with max 9 Tokens to store. So the counter only goes for more than 2 tokens which isn't a problem, because 0,1 Tokens are only occurring at the beginning of the game:

000 -> 2 Tokens <br />
001 -> 3 Tokens <br />
... <br />
111 -> 9 Tokens <br />

An example would look like: <br />
0b0010100111011101 00000000001111001110111011001011001110110010001 <br />

0-47: game board <br />
48-50: black token count <br />
51-53: white token count <br />
54-58: black possible moves <br />
59-63: white possible moves 

Disclaimer: This datastructure may seem a bit complicated as well as a few functions in the code. However, this was needed out of efficiency causes to get the maximum depth for the minimax algorithm.

### Minimax

The following pseudocode should give you a first grasp of the minimax algorithm. In my implementation white is the maximizing player
and black the minimizing one. Furthermore, I optimized the pruning by sorting the moves at the beginning of minimax with the static evaluation function. So the most likely best move is searched first in the computation tree.

```
fn minimax(game_board, depth, maximizing_player, alpha, beta) -> score {
    if depth == 0 or game is over
        return evaluate(game_board)

    if maximazingPlayer {
        maxEval = -infinity
        for each forward_board of game_board {
            eval = minimax(forward_board, depth-1, false, alpha, beta)
            maxEval = max(maxEval, eval)

            alpha = max(alpha, eval)
            if beta <= alpha {
                break
            }
        }
        return maxEval
    } else {
        minEval = +infinity
        for each forward_board of game_board {
            eval = minimax(forward_board, depth-1, true, alpha, beta)
            minEval = min(minEval, eval)

            beta = min(beta, eval)
            if beta <= alpha {
                break
            }
        }
        return minEval
    }
}
```

### Heuristic 

The static evaluation function used by minimax is build on a rather simple heuristic. From my testings a simple heuristic with less computation time and therefore greater depth for the minimax performed better than a more complex heuristic with less depth. So the score is evaluated like the following from the token counts and possible moves stored in the game board with more weight on token counts to favor closing mills:

```
fn evaluate(game_board) -> {
    if black wins {
        return -infinity
    } else if white wins {
        return +infinity
    }

    score += (white_token_count - black_token_count) * 20
    score += white_move_count - black_move_count
    return score
}
```
