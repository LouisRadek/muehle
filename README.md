## Introduction

This project originates from the modul "Mühle Ki Programmierprojekt" which was offered by the [FMI](https://www.fmi.uni-stuttgart.de/de/) at the University of Stuttgart in 2024.  
It implements the board game "Mühle" or in english "Nine Man Morris" with a simple game ui in pixel art. Furthermore, you can choose to play 1 vs. 1 or againt an Ai in diffrent difficulty levels.

**The pixel art was partially provied by [@purpurax](https://github.com/Purpurax) so big thanks for that.**
